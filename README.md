# "Gravity Server" Project

This repo contains the archived code that runs the backend/server hosting the (currently deprecated) Gravity mobile app project.

The project is a Web Application written in Python using the Django framework and using MySQL as the datastore. It was originally deployed to an Ubuntu 14.04 Linux instance, and the code has been written with this in mind. However, with proper installation of Python, Pip packages, and MySQL and configuration changes to the settings file, the project can be run on Windows servers as well.

## Note: this project is currently discontinued and is uploaded for archival purposed only
The project was discontinued in a working state, but it is not guaranteed to be bug-free. It may be edited later for cleanup, updated naming, or bug-fix purposes.

Given enough time, I hope to pick this project back up, reunite it with the Android client code (the other side of this project), and host it somewhere so as to get the app up and running again for demo or possibly real-world use.

Please note that the source folders have the name "JokrBackend" in them. This is because "Jokr" was the name of our mobile app before we changed the name to "Gravity" towards the end of the project. There are also some files which are auto-generated and need to be deleted (files in the "env" folder, for example, contain the “virtualenv” and “pip” files auto-generated for the python virtual environment). I will delete these and make other cleanup edits as soon as I can.
